Hi, my name is LiQingze. I'm a student from China. I'm really busy in this term, because I have a lot of subjects. such as Chinese,English,maths,history,geography,biology,and politics. 

I like all of the subjects, but my favourite is math, because it help me a lot. First, it's challenging. Second, it can help me think logically. Third, it can work out real problems.

I would like to be a mathematician in the future. Because I like maths really much. What about you? What do you want to be in the future?
