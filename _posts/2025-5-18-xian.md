# Hail in Xi'an
  There is a huge storm today.At the start,there are black clouds in the sky.It feels like 
something bad is comming.Then,the wind is blowing so hard that many trees are falling down.
At the last,peanut sized hails are hitting the windows.
  Every is scared because of lightning and thunder.So some are staying in,and some others are
rushing to go back home.It's difficult for people to do anything in such a bad weather!
